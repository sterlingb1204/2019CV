The first thing the program runs is a print statement that displays the start and end variables that the program will pass into the fizz_buzz_boom() function. Then the program will call the fizz_buzz_boom() function on (i,k). This will cause the fizz_buzz_boom() function to run a for-loop that uses the iterator variable, i, to traverse the range (start, end-1). The function will then use **chained conditional** execution to check if the i variable is divisible by 3, 5, and/or 7. If it satisfies any of the conditions it will return the respective string. Otherwise it will simply return the number. After i is checked against each condition, i will be incremented by 1. This will cause the function to continue its **repeated execution** in the fizz_buzz_boom() function until the i variable is equal to the end - 1 value. At this point, the function will stop and will cause the A1_TESTS loop to iterate through the next pair. The i variable will be equal to the next pair's start value and the k variable will be equal to the end value of that same pair. The loop will continue to run this process until it reaches the last pair in A1_TESTS and then it will stop.   </font>\n",
